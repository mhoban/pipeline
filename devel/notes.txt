Tools for contig assembly
---------------------------------------------------
velvet
bowtie
usearch

Tools to visualize assembly
---------------------------------------------------
IGV: interactive genome viewer


Strategy?
---------------------------------------------------
de novo assemble 2 pools, merge them with usearch, use that as reference?
cdhit against rainbow output to dereplicate 
(or usearch, which looks for reverse complements)
